# Segment IT -- Image segmentation of IT equipment using TensorFlow.js and MobileNet

This project contains an implementation of an image segmentation model used for identifying common IT equipment (e.g. keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.). Included are a pipeline for training a model and deploying a server for running inferences on edge devices -- provided they have an accessible camera.
